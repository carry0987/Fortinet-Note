To use IPv6, start by switching this on. Next, you will have use CLI interface to configure IPv6. You can open the CLI interface from the button in the top right corner of the admin interface. Then input the following commands in the CLI interface on the right. Please note that [WAN Interface] and [LAN Interface] represent Network -> Interface for the external and local network interface names. Please adjust according to the definitions in the Fortigate admin interface. Configure the external network interface (WAN) config sys int edit [WAN Interface] config ipv6 set ip6-mode pppoe set ip6-allowaccess ping set dhcp6-prefix-delegation enable set autoconf enable end next end When autoconf is enable, this sets the interface as SLAAC client. dhcp6-prefix-delegation enables DHCP-PD, to communicate with ISP to get prefix information. Configure the local network interface If there are multiple local network interfaces, you will have to configure each of them. config sys int edit [LAN Interface] config ipv6 set ip6-mode delegated set ip6-send-adv enable set ip6-manage-flag disable set ip6-other-flag enable set ip6-upstream-interface \"[WAN Interface]\" set ip6-subnet ::1/64 config ip6-delegated-prefix-list edit 1 set upstream-interface \"[WAN Interface]\" set autonomous-flag enable set onlink-flag enable set subnet ::/64 next end end next end Set IPv6 DNS settings This can be set through the admin interface. You can select either your ISP (CHT) or Google for your IPv6 DNS Server, both offer quick response times. CHT: Primary DNS server IP(ipv6): 2001:b000:168::1 Secondary DNS server IP(ipv6): 2001:b000:168::2 Google: Primary DNS server IP(ipv6): 2001:4860:4860::8888 Secondary DNS server IP(ipv6): 2001:4860:4860::8844 Set up an IPv6 DHCP Server If there are several local network interfaces, you need to configure each of them. config sys dhcp6 server edit 1 set interface \"[LAN Interface]\" set ip-mode delegated set dns-service default set upstream-interface \"[WAN Interface]\" next end Now you should be able to get the IPv6 address automatically from CHT, but after some testing you might find that the Domain Name still can't be queried correctly. A Google search shows that the IPv6 policy setting was missed. Set up IPv6 policies Add a policy for IPv6 local network to external network. In fact, you can adjust the policy according to your needs. The following example is set to accept all. Wait for 5~15 seconds. Then test with: diag ipv6 address list Note if the LAN interface has obtained an IPv6 address starting with 2001. If not, please reboot the FGT. Then check again with diag.
